                                The second term of the Global Councils on SDGs
                                will divert from a singular SDG approach to a
                                nexus approach. Giving the complexity and
                                interlinkages of the SDGs, the Councils will
                                galvanize and accelerate the implementation of
                                the goals through innovative partnerships,
                                inspiring projects, and informative white papers
                                that will advance our understanding of one
                                another as well as the challenges we face as a
                                society today.

                                Today we are at critical crossroads as the
                                COVID19- pandemic has caused major setbacks for
                                achieving the sustainable development goals
                                (SDGs). With the SDGs already off-track even
                                prior to the pandemic, the road to recovery is
                                steeper than ever. We are now facing critical
                                diversions as Advanced Economies were in a
                                better position to respond to the pandemic
                                compared to Emerging Market and Developing
                                Economies who were fiscally constrained. To
                                bring the SDGs back on track, national budgets
                                need to include SDGs priorities while, at the
                                same time, consistent and coordinated efforts to
                                foster partnerships to achieve the SDGs should
                                be intensified.

                                Health is a fundamental human right and
                                Universal Health Coverage is fundamental in
                                achieving that right. Unfortunately, even before
                                COVID19, the world was off track to achieving
                                UHC and SDG 3 overall, which is even more the
                                case today. Strengthening health systems, based
                                on strong PHC with essential public health
                                functions is our main solution for recovery and
                                building forward: to accelerate progress towards
                                UHC; to build resilience for health systems and
                                health security; and to access quality services
                                for health and wellbeing in an integrated way in
                                our everyday environment. The SDG 3 Council will
                                add momentum with global advocacy to these
                                efforts and therefore we are delighted to launch

                                solid roadmap to address the key challenges
                                facing humanity today. As we look ahead, we must
                                continue to recognize the interconnectedness of
                                global crises as an opportunity to deliver
                                collective impact for our current and future
                                generations.

                                Working alongside dynamic leaders within my

                                Councils, is a unique experience. This
                                initiative is truly global in its reach and
                                scope in that members come from around the
                                world, bringing diverse and thoughtful
                                perspectives on how to address complex global
                                challenges through the creation of large- and
                                small-scale innovations.

                                will support governments and private sector

                                A year into the journey of the SDG11 Global
                                Council, and as we look to the future, it is
                                clear that the sustainability of our cities and
                                communities will largely depend on the
                                collective efforts of governments, businesses,
                                and civil society. The council has endeavoured
                                to build back better and is making headway in
                                the global drive to build inclusive and
                                resilient sustainable cities and communities. At
                                the beginning of the journey, we called for
                                collective action to accelerate the scaling and
                                deployment of sustainable solutions, and today
                                we stand proud to have established partnerships
                                that will continue to have far-reaching impact
                                across the globe.

                                Now more than ever, we need to focus on
                                collaborative efforts to combat climate change.
                                Climate resilience, risk modelling, and capacity
                                building are the building blocks of such
                                collaborations. Through the multi-sector members
                                of the global council on SDG13 on climate
                                action, I am confident that 2023 is the year of
                                positive impact.

                                In the spirit of SDG 17, I see policy coherence
                                for sustainable development – PCSD – as a
                                particularly important lever for success.
                                Harnessing synergies and avoiding costly
                                trade-offs, both at home and abroad, will be
                                critical for driving change and accelerating
                                progress on the SDGs.

                                The UAE Global Council for SDGs is making steady
                                progress and collaborating to achieve impact on
                                SDGs 4, 8, and 17 through a Nexus model
                                approach. Our Council members are shaping a
                                sustainable future through exchanging
                                experiences and enhancing collaboration in
                                various sectors. We are very grateful that since
                                the last year, the Council has taken great
                                strides in advancing and accelerating progress
                                on the NOMU flagship initiative pioneered by the
                                Abdulla Al Ghurair Foundation to realize the
                                SDGs, focusing on the UAE through several

                                We are thrilled to have secured funding for the
                                Reading for Pleasure Initiative that will allow
                                us to move forward with our plans including the
                                vital research element. Initial work with Dubai
                                Schools resulted in the official inauguration of
                                the new school library by H.E. Aisha Miran; the
                                library now provides a key focal point for
                                students. It was wonderful to see the impact on
                                them, even after such a short time. The teachers
                                told us that their students have been so engaged
                                and excited and think the new library and the
                                author visits have provided the highlights of
                                the term for them. We look forward to embedding
                                a culture and love of reading in our chosen six
                                pilot schools and working closely with parents,
                                teachers, and students to create centres of
                                reading excellence, and a model that can provide

                                As the world's leading trade enabler, it is
                                critical that we become vanguards of the
                                communities we operate in. That's why at DP

                                GIS plays a vital role in implementing and
                                tracking progress on the UN SDGs across all
                                countries. GIS and location provide a key
                                technology that enables global citizens
                                everywhere to track and compare their progress
                                on the SDGs. GIS enables global citizens
                                everywhere to report, track, and understand our
                                progress across various goals within their own
                                locales as well as others.
